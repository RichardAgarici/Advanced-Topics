Exceptions : All Exceptions, are classes which have the Object class as their parent.

Checked : Exceptions that should be anticipated. (like dividing to 0) (or the file doesn't exist)

Unchecked : Exceptions are not because of the compiler, it's happening in the programming error.
Examples :
NullPointerException: if you use a null value in a return.
ArithmeticException: if some math operation is not compatible x/0 for example.
IllegalArgumentException : argument was not accepted.
IndexOutOfBoundException : calling an index that doesn't exist.
IllegalStateException : which gets thrown if you try to call a method, but it's not in the right state.

Error : Indicates errors outside the Java application
Examples :
StackOverFlow: type of buffer overflow error that occurs when a computer program tries to use more memory space in the
call stack than has been allocated to that stack.
OutOfMemoryError: Occupies the entire java memory dedicated for processing the application.
(Infinity recursions.)(broken while loop.)
